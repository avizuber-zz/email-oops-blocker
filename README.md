# email-oops-blocker
Chrome Extension for Gmail to prevent users from accidentally hitting "Reply to All" on an email they're BCC'd on.

Have you ever been BCC'd on an email? It usually means the other recipients in the thread are not supposed to know you were included. If you accidentally click "Reply to All", instead of "Reply", everyone will know. Email Oops Blocker alerts with you with a friendly reminder if you accidentally hit "Reply to All" on an email you were BCC'd on. 
It works in Gmail.
